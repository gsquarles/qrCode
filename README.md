## My process
This took me about an hour to create just using a mix of flexbox to align items and some grid as well to center things.
It was a good beginner project to help me practice recreating the item.  I wish it didn't take as long as it did
but nonetheless it was good practice.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### Continued development

I would like to be able to create something like this in about 15 minutes or so.  And not using a weird mixture of
grid to Center things and flexbox in another.  I feel if I was truly proficient in flexbox I could of easily made the whole
thing with only that.
